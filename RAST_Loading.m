% RAST: Rapid Analysis of Slip Traces, original version written by Vincent Gagneur (2022-2025)
% The release of the code accompanies a paper which describes its main
% functionalities, and how to interpet the data output in more details, as applied to indentation generated slip traces for bcc/B2 slip activities,  see V. Gagneur et. al. "automated indentation-based slip trace
% analysis for bcc and B2 plasticity" (expected publication in 2025)
%
% This code requires the "image processing toolbox" from mathworks (install
% via "apps", "get more apps", and find it there). It is possible that it
% depends on other functions from other apps (which I forgot about), just read the error messages when running the
% code and it should be indicated which matlab toolbox you need to install.
%
% This matlab file is used to load a new dataset, prompting the user to
% define each picture, crop/mask unwanted features, and attribute Euler
% angles to each picture.
% 
% In this part of the code you have:
%
% (1) picture loading by user,
%
% (2)/(3) picture cropping / masking by user, to hide indent, other grain
% areas, and large highly contrasted linear feature that risk getting detected
%
% (4) User manually associating the EBSD determined Euler angles.
% 
% Important!!!, currently pictures from the same grain orientation should
% be entered one after the others, or the grain ID numeration in "(8)"
% output by the code will mistakenly give different grain numbers to pictures from the same
% grain. (note that the actual Euler angle values are output in the excel
% file, so user can double check here whether the grain IDs are correctly attributed and manually fix it if needed).
