# RAST v1.0
Code for Rapid Analysis of Slip Traces

This code is associated with a paper published here: (waiting for post-proof final DOI link)

See "tutorial" text files and comments in code for further guidance, if you need any help feel free to contact me at vincent26100@gmail.com

I was not able to upload the tutorial data files (indent pictures and pre-loaded datasets) due to large file sizes, I will try to find an alternative approach. In the mean time contact me if you want some test data.


To do list for future updates:

- clean up the scoring procedure for better readability + easier editing
